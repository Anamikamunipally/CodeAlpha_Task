# CodeAlpha_Task
This Repository contains four Python mini-projects that I completed during my internship at CodeAlpha.
Each task helped me strenghthen my coding logic, improve problem-solving skills, and explore how python can be applied in real-world scenarios.
## Project Included
1.Task-1 : [Stock Portfolio Tracker]
    A Python program that helps tracker and manage stock investments. It allowed me to practice working with APIs and handling real-time financial data.
2.Task-2 : [Task Automation Script]
    A Small automation project that performs routine tasks efficiently. Through this, I learned how to use Python libraries for automating repetitive processes.
3.Task-3 : [Basic Chatbot]
    A Simple text-based chatbot that interacts with users using predefined responses. This project gave me hands-on experience with NLP basics and logic flow.
4.Task-4 : [Hangman Game]
    A fun word-guessing game built using Python.This project helped me understand loops, conditionals, and string manipulation in an interactive way.
